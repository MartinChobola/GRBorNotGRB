# GRBorNotGRB

Machine learning technique to detect Gamma Ray Bursts


Speedrun to Mgr.

2.3. (1/??)
- Introduction to LSTM
- Applying LSTM on GRBalpha data
- surprisingly good results
- predicting 6th point by previous five points (only on rate)
  didn't checked with known GRB
- tried to predict only the path of satelite (didn't finish)

TO DO TOMORROW
- check predictions during known GRB
- finish LSTM model with more variables (lat,lon,alt?)
