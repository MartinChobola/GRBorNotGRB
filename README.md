# GRBorNotGRB

Machine learning technique to detect Gamma Ray Bursts


Speedrun to Mgr.
-----------------------------------------------
2.3. (1/??)
- Introduction to LSTM
- Applying LSTM on GRBalpha data (surprisingly good results)
- predicting 6th point by previous five points (only on rate)
  didn't checked with known GRB
- tried to predict only the path of satelite (didn't finish)
- bought Colab pro, ordered new componets for PC

TO DO TOMORROW
- check predictions during known GRB x
- finish LSTM model with more variables (lat,lon,..) ðŸ—¸

-----------------------------------------------
3.3. (2/??)
- made progress with more variables (lat, lon) in LSTM intro
  output has correct shape
- liturature reading and searching for references

TO DO TOMORROW
- build PC with new components
- find indexes of known GRB and check predictions
- continue on LSTM with lat,lon variables
